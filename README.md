make dev
```

Run the application as a background service with the --no-tui flag:

```bash
make dev ARGS="--no-tui"
```

### Command-line Flags

The application supports the following command-line flags:

- `--no-tui`: Run only the API server without the TUI
- `--port <number>`: Specify the port for the API server (default: 8080)
- `--dev`: Run in development mode (uses local database)
- `--init`: Initialize the database
- `--help`: Show help message
- `--verbose`: Show detailed output

Example:
```bash
# Run API server on port 3000 in development mode
./timesheet --no-tui --port 3000 --dev

# Show help message
./timesheet --help
```

The application uses keyboard shortcuts for navigation and actions. See the
[keyboard shortcuts guide](docs/shortcuts.md) for a comprehensive list of
available commands.

## Configuration

The application can be configured through `config.json`:

- Set document type (PDF/Excel) for exports
- Configure email settings (requires Resend.com API key)
- Enable/disable API server
- Set development mode to avoid cluttering production data

## Development

Within the config file, make sure to set mode to "development" to not clutter
your production data.
